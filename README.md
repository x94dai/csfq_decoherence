# csfq_decoherence
This repository contains data on the decoherence rate of a tunable capacitively-shunted flux qubit (CSFQ), and code used to analyze them. The corresponding publication can be found on manuscript can be found on [Trappen, R., Dai, X., Yurtalan, M.A. et al. Decoherence of a tunable capacitively shunted flux qubit. Commun Phys 8, 453 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-025-02360-2), or [arXiv:2307.13961](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.13961). 

The respository is organized as follows
- Data: contains experimental data
- Simulation: contains simulated decoherence rates
- DeviceParameters: contains circuit model parameters and qubit sensitivities to various noise channels, as simulated using a generic circuit Hamiltonian builder (private code, methodoligies explained in detail in [arXiv:2010.14929](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14929)
